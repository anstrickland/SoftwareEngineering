  <h3> <head> Welcome to Libro to Go! </head></h3>

 <body>
	
	<p>This website is a culmination of the knowledge we've acquired throughout our Computer Science career. Created for our CS 407 
	Software Engineering course, LibroToGo is a website dedicated to providing students on Meredith's campus an easy opportunity 
	to make some money back on the plethora of textbooks collected throughout the year. 
	Craigslist is too risky, Ebay is too expensive when PayPal, seller, and postal fees are included, and the campus bookstore is a racket 
	- 2 bucks for a 200 dollar textbook, only to turn around and sell it for full price.
	Facebook has somewhat mitigated the problem, but it's easy for your post to get buried during 
	textbook buying/selling season. With LibroToGo, you can sell and buy all your textbooks in one dedicated website. 
	Just pop in your information, browse the website for next semesters textbooks and post some books that you're finished 
	using and we'll take care of the rest. No longer will you have to worry about receiving the correct edition or getting 
	your textbook in time for classes. 

	</br>Thanks and enjoy,

	</br>The LibroToGo team
